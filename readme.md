#  SecurityVue India Webinar

**About webinar** : Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel — is a month-long celebration of open-source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.
